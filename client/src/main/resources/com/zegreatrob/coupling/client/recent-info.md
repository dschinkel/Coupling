On **April 10** this application is going to be transitioning to a new database backend (in the evening). All data should be transported, but afterwards, feel free to spot check your data history and make sure everything is in order. If you have a problem, open an issue at [the github](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling) and we'll get things fixed up.

If you want to be extra careful, inspect the graphql call on current pair assignment page, and save the response... it should include everything in the history of your tribe. Easy, eh? Compare that to the one the shows up on April 11, and *fingers crossed* everything should be fine.
