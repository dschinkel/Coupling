# About

Welcome to Coupling! The program that tries to make it as easy to pair as possible.

If you're new... hi! Glad to have you. If you don't already have one, you'll create a "tribe", and then add "players" to it. Once you've got a few players, you can *spin* in order to automatically generate a set of pairs.

Now, the automatic matching is *not* random. The program will do its best to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to pair with everyone else, and it prioritizes "couples" that haven't seen each other for a while. Information about how long its been for each "couple" is available on the tribe's statistics page.

If you have questions, curses, or compliments, feel free to contact me. My information is on my [homepage](https://robertfmurdock.github.io), and you can always leave issues on [the github page](https://www.github.com/robertfmurdock/coupling)!
